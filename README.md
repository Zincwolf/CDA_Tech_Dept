Hi! This is the repo which consists of workshop materials and codes.

We are planning to hold the first workshop on Oct 23. It's about Quant Jargon and 3 Python projects that equip you with the basic idea of what to learn in the future to be a better Quant. Participating in the workshop requires no premier knowledge - it's freshmen-friendly! The textbook will be updated after we hold the workshop.
